Praqma is not your average consultancy. Our business is about delivering change to ambitious clients who are seeking to upgrade their development process through DevOps and Continuous Delivery.  We inspire, counsel, guide, and assist our clients through the whole journey.

We bring expertise, experience and best practice to the transformation. When we engage, we work directly with the customer's own people and we help them excel.

Our policy with our clients is _buy a man and get a team_ which in plain English translates to _the direct opposite of body shopping_. We give the customer access to all of Praqma's expertise. We deliver our work as a service, and it includes expertise in any approach or technology that could fit into the DevOps tool stack or Continuous Delivery methodology.

No _one_ person can deliver all that alone.

## The Wolf and the Praqtitioner

If you've watched the movie _"Pulp Fiction"_ then you know that _Mr. Wolf_ is someone who can handle a [_"Bonnie Situation"_](/stories/the-bonnie-situation/). We use the term _wolves_ to describe our most senior consultants. Wolves solve problems - and we need more wolves!

Every time we engage with a customer, we need a _Wolf_ on-site. The wolf's job is to understand the customer's need, facilitate their personnel, know exactly when to bring in another expert or a _Praqtitioner_.
A _Praqtitioner_  is a consultant who is eager, enthusiastic, engaged - but less experienced than our wolves. _Praqtitioners_ take a more hands-on approach in implementing the pipeline and the supporting tools. _Praqtitioners_ usually evolve into wolves over time.

- Wolves are thought leaders, they inspire colleagues and clients.
- Wolves are experienced practitioners in the field of DevOps and Continuous Delivery.
- Wolves know how to deal with [_"Bonnie Situations"_](stories/the-bonnie-situation/) in the wild.
- Wolves have an agile mindset.

Our wolves and praqtitioners work closely with each other inside Praqma. They share work and they carry the knowledge of their colleagues to their own clients.

Additionally, in Praqma, it is everyone's job to undertake research.  Our business is based on a moving target of the latest technologies and approaches, so we need to learn the latest technology, apply it, and most importantly teach and promote it internally and to the world.

As part of our work in teaching and preaching Continuous Delivery, we use some of our time on hosting and facilitating different events. In Aarhus we manage the official Docker Aarhus group as well as the more general CoDe:U - Continouos Delivery Users group. Typically we have one or two meetups each quarter.

## Are you it?
We are currently looking for both _Wolves_ and _Praqtitioners_ for our Aarhus based office. From Aarhus we cover customers in Jutland.

Praqma wants to recruit, grow and __keep__ awesome people!
We strive to have workdays both on-site at customers and at the office with our colleagues.
Our clients also get smarter consultants this way.

If you have any questions regarding Praqma and how we work, please call Lars on +45 20 87 25 30 or mail him on [lak@praqma.com](mailto:lak@praqma.com).
