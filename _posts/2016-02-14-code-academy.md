{: .highlight}


## What will I learn?

The bootcamp will be an intense 5-day course taking you through all the basics of continuous delivery.

* __Build and test automation__: with Jenkins
* __Test Driven Development__: Build quality in
* __Build, Ship, Run__: with Docker
{: .checkmark}

## Is it really free?

Yes. Really.

## What's the catch?

There's no such thing as a free lunch, right?

Each lunch time there will be a short presentation from one of the sponsors about their company.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a job doesn't it make sense to hear from great employers who take training seriously? :-D

But seriously, the lunch *will be free!*

## Who is eligible?

You should:

* Be a student or unemployed recent graduate
* Have Studied Computer Science or related field
* Want to learn the latest software techniques
* Want to have fun!
{: .checkmark}


## Where and When will it happen?

In the summer, final dates are to be announced shortly but this is currently what we're aiming at:

* __Copenhagen:__ Mid August
* __Aarhus:__ End of August
* __Trondheim:__ End of August or beginning of September
* __Oslo:__ End of August or beginning of September

## How do I get involved?

Spaces will be limited by the locations we find, so there will be a selection process involved. If you are interested in attending please [fill out the form below](#interested) - If you have _any_ questionn then just mail at [code-academy@praqma.com](mailto:code-academy@praqma.com).

## My company loves this idea! Can we sponsor?

Sure - [send us a mail](mailto:code-academy@praqma.com?subject=Please!+We+want+to+know+more+about+sponsoring+CoDe+Academy) and we can set up a chat!

## Why is Praqma organizing this?

Here's the thing - demand for Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills is far outstripping what is available the in the job market.  In a way, we at Praqma are feeling this most acutely.  We have fantastic demand for our consulting and training offerings, business has more than doubled over the last year.  Meanwhile back at the ranch we are actively recruiting for open positions in all our locations.

When scheming solutions for this challenge, our first thought was obvious - we train our customers, why not train our recruits!
{: .highlight}

And it makes sense.  We take training very seriously at Praqma, and understand that only by continuous learning can we deliver the best value to our customers.  We invest a lot of time in experimenting with new technology, finding great development workflows, and sharing what we learn.  Why not train our recruits?

But then a second thought came - instead of only training our recruits, why not train all recruits?  Why not make this available to everyone looking for work, so that not only Praqma employees get these skills but all people entering the industry?
