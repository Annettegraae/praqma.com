The Copenhagen CoDe Academy 2016 got off to a flying start.
100 final year software engineering students signed up to learn about our modern Continuous Delivery methods, and they got what they asked for.

## Welcome to CoDe Academy Copenhagen 2016

Praqma is a leading software development consulting company that helps businesses build better software.
Ordinarily, our team members help to implement change through teaching - usually in large corporations.
That’s our day-to-day work, and we love it, but we are also dedicated to [supporting the next generation of software developers](http://www.praqma.com/stories/praqticum/)

So, this summer, we are sharing some of our most coveted knowledge with 400 students across Northern Europe.
The initiative is called Code Academy and it’s completely free for all our participants.

### Let the CoDe begin

Professor for the day, Praqma’s Mike Long, got the students on their feet from the very first module: the tool dropping workshop.
The participants, still perhaps a little shy, were equipped with good old fashioned chalk and asked to accumulate every possible software tool on the blackboard.
And the Continuous Delivery games had begun.

After an introduction to typical challenges in real life software assignments, the students were presented with the topic of the day - the principles of agile task management. And then the academy got truly hands on:

12.000 Legos were put on the table, and gave the software talents access to a very realistically simulated Scrum process.

Teams were made, the infamous next-level project managers, Scrum masters, appointed, and product owners introduced.
Software-/Lego builders were asked to estimate assignments like “Build a complete city, including houses, hospitals, bus stops and a river.” A race between the teams was soon under way. There were chuckles and bursts of laughter as the students built away, racing against the clock, trying to stick to the assignments, the time boxes, and the workflow.

### “Time’s up. Step. Away. From the Legos.”

The first feedback session was designed to be as harsh as anything from the real world.
Product owners might have a clear idea about what they want or how they want it, but communicating requirements is a hurdle, and often it’s not until the product owners are presented with a first stage product that they can clearly state what they did NOT have in mind.

So, the students were scolded when they understandably forgot to update kanban boards and stick to color schemes (that weren’t defined!)
-and teams were scrambled, as Scrum masters transferred, team members moved, - and then it was back to the next stage of the process.

### Just as in real life. But better

All participants seem to go through every stage of a typical work process: initial enthusiasm, confusion, frustration, breakthrough, and then the last exciting sprint towards the finish as the different teams see their work becoming part of the final project.

And how did the future CoDer's like it? Well, one student cracked a smile and said simply, “I loved it!”
