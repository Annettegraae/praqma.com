This is the bloody but in the end edifying tale about "The Bonnie Situation", which we in Praqma use as a metaphor for what consultancy is all about - solving problems. You'll be introduced to Mr. Wolf - or just 'Winston' for those who are on first name with the gentleman - and you will learn why we consider him a role model for any consultant.

# The Bonnie Situation

The story you are about to read is a retelling of one of the many parallel stories, that are told in Quentin Tarantino's movie Pulp Fiction - ranked as #7 on IMDM all-time-best-movies list.
{: .cuff}

Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are sitting in front of a car. On the back seat is the young boy Marvin. This has been the worst day in Marvin's life, which by the way is about to come to an end real soon.

![Big Kahuna Burger](/images/stories/bonnie/jules-bkb.jpg){: .pic .small .left} Just before this car ride, Jules and Vincent went to an apartment somewhere in Los Angeles, where four young boys were having their breakfast (Big Kahuna Burgers). The purpose of their visit was to collect a briefcase of something very
[precious](https://www.google.com/search?q=pulp%20fiction%20what%27s%20in%20the%20case%20theory){: target="_blank" }, which the boys unfortunately forgot to deliver to their business partner Mr. Marcellus Wallace - who also happens to be Vincent and Jules boss - hence the visit.

Now they have successfully collected Marcellus' briefcase and they have also wiped out three of the four young boys - the fourth boy was Marvin who was in on the job as an insider.

The last one of the three boys that Vincent and Jules shot in the apartment actually managed to empty his gun agains the two - but all six bullets missed. Jules claims it was a miracle. Vincent calls it a coincidence - now they are having a deranged conversation on the subject of _divine intervention_.

The conversation between Jules and Vincent is leading nowhere, Vincent turns towards Marvin on the back seat:

![Vincent Ooops](/images/stories/bonnie/vincent-oops.png){: .pic .center .medium}

    Vincent:    Marvin, what do you make of all this?
    Marvin:     Man!!! I don't even have an opinion!
    Vincent:    Well, you gotta have an opinions! I mean, do you think that God
                came down from heaven and stopped those bull...

            --- Vincent's gun goes off: BANG! ---

Mostly as a habit, Jules is holding a gun in his hand. Suddenly the gun goes off and now Marvin's brain is all over the '74 Chevy Nova.

Both Jules and Vincent is starting to panic. They have to get the car off the road PRONTO! But despite the seriousness of the situation they are side tracking into a discussion whether the were - or weren't - a bump in the road.

Jules is making a phone call to his friend Jimmi who lives near by. They will have to use his garage for a couple of hours.

In the meantime Jimmi isn't especially thrilled about the fact that his house has now become _"a dead nigger storage"_ at he puts it. His wife Bonnie will be home from work in one and a half hour and surely he will get a divorce if she sees a dead body in her house when she comes home. Both Vincent and Jules understands the severity of The Bonnie Situation - It's just that they haven't got a clue about how to solve it.

Jimmi clearly don't think that Jules and Vincent have the situation under control. Jules calls their boss - Marcellus - and he fills him in on the problem. Marcellus starts to analyze the situation, which only makes Jules panic even more:

![marcellus](/images/stories/bonnie/marcellus.png){: .pic .center .medium}

    Jules:	    All I wanna hear from your as is: "You ain't got no problems
                Jules - I'm on the motherfucker - Go back in there and chill
                them niggers out and wait for the cavalry which will be coming
                - directly".
    Marcellus:  You ain't got no problems Jules - I'm on the motherfucker - Go
                back in there and chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf
                which will be coming - directly.
    Jules:	    ...Are you sending the wolf?
    Marcellus:  Do you feel better motherfucker?
    Jules:	    Shit negro! That's all you had to say!

Nine minutes twenty seconds later the door bell is ringing at Jimmi's house. Jimmi opens the door outside is Mr. Wolf: _"You are Jimmi! right? This is your house! I'm Winston Wolf - I solve problems"_

![74 Chevy Nova with brains](/images/stories/bonnie/74-chevy-nova-with-brains.jpg){: .pic .center .medium} They now have 40 minutes left to solve "The Bonnie Situation". Mr. Wolf is taking the lead and lays out a very detailed plan for how to clean brains out of a 1974 Chevy Nova. Jimmi provides the cleaning products. The situation is tense and after the thorough and detailed instructions from Mr. Wolf, Vincent is not satisfied with the _tone_ and he's reluctant to get started before the communication is sorted out:

    Mr. Wolf:   Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
    Vincent:    A please would be nice.
    Mr. Wolf:   Come again?
    Vincent:    I said a please would be nice.
    Mr. Wolf:   Get it straight buster - I'm not here to say please, I'm here
                to tell you what to do and if self-preservation is an instinct
                you possess you'd better fucking do it and do it quick. I'm
                here to help - if my help's not appreciated then lotsa luck,
                gentlemen.
    Jules:      No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that, your help is definitely
                appreciated.
    Vincent:    I don't mean any disrespect, I just don't like people barking
                orders at me.
    Mr. Wolf:   I'm curt with you because time is a factor. I think
                fast, I talk fast and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna
                get out of this. So, pretty please... with sugar on top. Clean
                the fucking car.

![Clean the fucking car](/images/stories/bonnie/clean-the-fucking-car.jpg){: .pic .center .medium}

Eventually, the car get's cleaned up, and the two unlucky fellows gets a good was by the garden hose. Jimmi finds some of his old clothes they can wear. Quite a bit more casual that what they are used to, but surely good enough.

Along with all this work going on Mr. Wolf manages to ease Jimmi into a sentiment where he is quite calm and relaxed, despite the fact that Bonnie probably already is on her way home from work. Mr. Wolf drops off the car, and the dead body of Marvin in the trunk, at Monster Joe's Car dismantle site.

Just before he takes off himself with Monster Joe's daughter Rachel, Jules and Vincent thanks him sincerely.

![Vincent and Jules, Thank you](/images/stories/bonnie/jules-vincent-thank-you.jpg){: .pic .center .medium }

    Jules:      Mr. Wolf! I just wanna tell you: It's been a real pleasure
                watching you work!
    Vincent:    Yeah! I agree: Thank you very much Mr. Wolf!
    Mr. Wolf:   Call me Winston.

# The interpretation

The Bonnie Situation and the characters in it is a great metaphor for what consultancy in the software development industry is all about. We use all these characters as personas - the interpretation should be obvious
{: .cuff}

In the real world of our consulting, where our clients are all engaged in software development themselves and have very skilled employees, we are working together with customers and facilitating them. This is how we use the characters as personas:

## Jules and Vincent: The Customer's own developers

Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are the personnel employed by _the customer_. They are the ones that need consultancy! Now if one of our customers read this, he or she might get somewhat insulted by that comparison as it appears - at least in the beginning - that they are doing really bad. But in the end when The Bonnie Situation is avoided and looking back on their behavior, they actually did The Right Thing. They requested help and they participated very actively in the problem solving.

![Dance with Miss Mia](/images/stories/bonnie/dance.jpg){: .pic .center .medium }

Both Jules and Vincent have a lot of very fine unquestionable qualities and skills within their own specific domains of expertise. In one scene Vincent is baby-sitting Marcellus Wallace's wife - Miss Mia - and he takes her out dancing which he does in a truly convincing manner. And Jules, as it turns out, is really a very thoughtful man with deep profound understanding of what life is all about and on top of that he has excellent communication skills - as he reveals in the delicate situation with Honey Bunny and Pumpkin at the diner.

![Jules communication skills](/images/stories/bonnie/ringo-pumpkin-jules-vincent.jpg){: .pic .center .medium }

The are both very clever at - what ever they are good at.

Like the typical customer's personnel, Jules and Vincent are very competent at handling difficult situation on home-court (e.g. like picking up the briefcase for Marcellus - remember? That was a delicate situation where they did well!). But even talented people do - now and then - find themselves in situations where they don't have the necessary means to cope: They simply need help from experts.

If you try to analyze: Why is the Bonnie Situation really such an interesting story that Tarantino finds it worth telling? Sure it's fascinating to see Mr. Wolf's charisma and talent be laid out in front of you. But the twist of the story, which makes it a good one, is that Jules and Vincent practically does all the actual work themselves. They just needed a guide.

## The Bonnie Situation: The Customer's Problem

Now when you know the story about _The Bonnie Situation_ we can introduce the same term to be a metaphor for _The Customer's Problem_. The definition is: Some delicate situation that requires a solution - failure is not an option - within a limited time and with limited resources. It's a situation that requires on-site help from an expert.

## Jimmi and Bonnie: The consumers

Jimmi - and potentially also Bonnie, in case the situation is not handled well - are being dragged into Vincent's and Jules' business without really wanting to be. Sure Jimmi wants to help his friend Jules with his problem - but he doesn't want to become divorced doing it.

As he says to the blood soaked Jules when he's standing in front of him in his own kitchen: _There is nothing you can say that can make me forget that I love my wife! Is there?_

![Nothing you can say](/images/stories/bonnie/nothing-you-can-say.jpg){: .pic .center .medium}

Jimmi insists, that even if he is indeed suffering from the problem that Vincent and Jules opposed upon him, he still has no part in it, and therefore he's only willing to take part in the solution to a very limited extend. He is giving them some leash, but his demands are basically non-negotiable.
In other words: Jimmi and Bonnie are the source of all the pressure that is currently on Jules and Vincent!

It's like that in the real world too; The only reason for any piece of software to exist is - at the end og the day - to make the intended end users happy. And there is nothing you can say, than can make them forget that.

## Marcellus Wallace: The Customer's management layer

![Marcellus at the pool with Miss Mia](/images/stories/bonnie/marcellus-at-the-pool-with-mia.jpg){: .pic .right .small } Marcellus Wallace is the obvious place where Jules can call - and expect to get help. He need to flag this delicate Bonnie situation to his boss, His own understanding of the situation is that he needs the entire cavalry. Marcellus asks Jules for details about the The Bonnie Situation and based on his analysis he takes the full ownership of the problem and he gives Jules what he requests - well, not an entire army, but he's sending the Wolf.

Management that behaves like this is really doing an excellent job at managing. He listens carefully and without hesitation he acknowledges full ownership of the problem, he organizes facilitation of his own people rather than bringing on the entire cavalry.

## Winston Wolf: The Consultant

Mr. Wolf represents the consultant. I don't know how many times before Mr. Wolf has been in charge of cleaning '74 Chevy Nova for brains but my guess is that it is probably zero. Never the less; When Marcellus calls him, fills him in on the situation and gives him the address of Jimmi's house he replies _"It's thirty minutes away - I'll be there in ten"_. He is giving The Bonnie Situation his full attention and even if it's very likely that it's a new situation for Mr. Wolf too - it resembles the many other situations he has dealt with during his time, that he's not hesitating at all.

![I'm Wolf - I solve problems](/images/stories/bonnie/im-wolf-i-solve-problems.png){: .pic .center .medium}

When he arrives at Jimmi's house it turns out that both Vincent and Jules are actually quite competent after all - after a while at least - as it's already pointed out, they end up doing the most of the actual work, despite the fact that they weren't capable of doing _anything_ until Mr. Wolf arrived.

Mr. Wolf's professionalism is so radiant, that he manages to set the mood in the house to a level, where everybody ends up believing that they will eventually make it - even Jimmi is calmed down.

At some point, Jimmi has a 1-o-1 conversation with Mr. Wolf, about the fact that all the sheets and linen he's letting Vincent and Jules use to cover the inside of the '74 Chevy Nova was a wedding present to him and Bonnie from uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny, who are both no longer with us.

    Mr. Wolf:   You uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny, were they millionaires?
    Jimmi:      No.
    Mr. Wolf:   Well, your uncle Marcellus is.
    Mr. wolf:   And I'm positive that if uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny were here,
                they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set. Which your
                uncle Marcellus is more than happy to do.

            --- Mr. Wolf pulls out a fat bunch of bills from his pocket ---

    Mr. Wolf:   I like oak myself, that's what I have in my bedroom. How
                about you Jimmi - You and oak man?
    Jimmi:      Oak's nice!

Again Mr. Wolf delivers more than what's expected from him, and doing it is exactly what builds strong and lasting relationships.

## Jimmi, Marcellus, Joe and Rachel: The Personal Network

Let me recap: __Jules__ and __Vincent__ ends up in a bad situation in an unfriendly neighborhood, he calls his friend __Jimmi__ who let's them use his garages, But only until __Bonnie__ comes home. Jules then calls his boss __Marcellus__, who calls __Winston Wolf__. Mr. Wolf makes Jimmi comfortable and instructs Jules and Vincent on how they should work. While at the same time eases Jimmi to a state of sentiment, by praising his coffee, paying respect to his late __uncle Conrad__ and __aunt Ginny__. When he needs to dispose the car, he get's help from __Monster Joe__ who dismantles and disposes cars and in the end he proudly takes off with Joe's daughter __Rachel__ who he presents to Jules and Vincent with the words _"This is Monster Joe's daughter - some day all of this will be hers"_ - pointing to the huge piles of useless junk cars - as if they were made of gold, and by that statement pays respect to both Monster Joe and Rachel in the same sentence.

The Bonnie Situation ends with the following dialog.

    Jules:     Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you, that it was a real pleasure
               watching you work.
    Vincent:   Yeah, I really enjoyed it, and thank you Mr. Wolf.
    Mr. wolf:  Call me Winston.

Now they are on first name with each others. Bonds have been made.

It's really all about relations between people. Everywhere Mr. Wolf is coming he's either maintaining his relations with people - or making new ones. These relations are his true assets - well and his skills of course, but they are so obvious.

## Conclusion

Mr Wolf is a role model!

_Winston_  - now we're on first name with the guy - Should be a role model for any consultant. At the very least, he should be a character that they should strive to understand, so that they themselves can learn how to exploit their own abilities and relations, as well as other's abilities and relations to a degree where it appears agile and untroubled and yet with a clear gain for all parties involved.

He's own presentation of himself is _"I'm Winston Wolf - I solve problems"_.

Now! If you yourself are a consultant, then the advise shall be: Meet you customer with that attitude. If you yourself is a Customer, that is; Someone who uses consultants, then the advise shall be: Expect that attitude from your consultant.

# Wolfware

Internally in Praqma we're using the term "WolfWare" almost as a methodology. It captures the essence of what we're doing and it sets the scene.
{: .cuff}

__WolfWare implies that the customer is quite competent and ambitious himself.__ The customer wouldn't normally go and hire a Wolf unless the problem is of such a nature that an on-site expert is really needed.
{: .wolf-item}

__WolfWare means that the consultants are in the Winston Wolf League.__ They are skilled far above average, and they have that _I solve problems_ attitude. They will pull the necessary stings in their personal network to solve the problem. The may not have tried every possible Bonnie Situation that there is. But they have solved so many different Bonnie Situations that you can tell without doubt that - problem solving is their business.
{: .wolf-item}

__WolfWare means that the flip-side of the Wolf metaphor has been mitigated actively.__ The consultants are not lone predators. Surely they are all capable of working alone, but they are now gathered in a pack where they exploit each others strengths - to a sum that reveals no weaknesses.
{: .wolf-item}

__WolfWare is about being generous.__ It's means taking the time and energy to praise another man's gourmet coffee, even if you are really there to clean up another man's brain. Giving your best even when it's more than what was expected. _under-commit_ and _over-deliver_.
{: .wolf-item}

__WolfWare is that _I solve Problems attitude_.__ It's an avalanche of not-afraid - and at the same time never throwing dice with death. Failure is not an option. The problem will be solved - one way or another. We _never_ lose.
{: .wolf-item}
