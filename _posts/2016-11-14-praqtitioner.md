<!--break-->

Praqma is not your average consultancy. Our business is about delivering change to ambitious clients who are seeking to upgrade their development process - through DevOps and Continuous Delivery. We inspire, counsel, guide, and assist our clients through the whole process.

We have offices in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Oslo and Stockholm and we’re about to open in Göteborg - we need more skilled Praqtitioners in all locations.

We take pride in the fact that all our customers are ambitious about adopting the Continuous Delivery mindset and want to work with modern development technologies and approaches.

What this means is that we implement Continuous Delivery and DevOps in some of the most challenging and demanding real-life scenarios.

Our credo is: _buy a man and get a team_ - which in plain english translates to _the direct opposite of body shopping_. None of our customers have ever seen a CV on any of our consultants. We deliver our work as a service, and it includes expertise in any approach or technology that could fit into the DevOps tool-stack or Continuous Delivery methodology.

# What's the job?

A typical engagement with a client is founded in a well studied understanding of the customer's situation, a prioritized roadmap and a close engagement with the customer's personnel onsite. We always have a Wolf on-site. _"Wolf"_ is our nickname for senior consultants - referring to Mr. Wolf in _"Pulp Fiction"_ who introduces himself _"I'm Winston Wolf - I Solve problems"_.

The wolf will work with our Continuous Delivery Praqtitioners. Praqtitioners are consultants with a dedicated engagement in Continuous Delivery and DevOps. People who have chosen this domain of knowledge as their career and who take pride in delivering quality - in everything they do.

Being a Praqtitioner in Praqma is itself a learning experience - it takes offset in [our approach to learning](/stories/praqticum/). You will be solving real problems, in challenging environments. While wolfs will be available to guide and mentor you.

- Praqtitioners are determined and ambitious, they embrace the concept of DevOps and Continuous Delivery.
- Praqtitioners want to learn and grow.
- Praqtitioners know that deep down - software is really about people.
- Praqtitioners are craftsmen.

# Are you it?

Maybe you have been doing this Continuous Delivery and DevOps stuff for a while but you're tired of doing it sporadically - and alone - in a team that sees you more as an assistant than an innovator.

Maybe you've been doing it in place where it's not even difficult, but now you want to take it to new heights in mission impossible scenarios like global corporations, industrial settings, and regulated environments.

Maybe you're just fascinated about how technology in general can really speed up software development by building quality in the process.

If you are a Praqtitioner who wants to become part of Scandinavia's largest Continuous Delivery tribe, we currently need people like you at the following locations: Oslo, Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö.

If you have any questions before applying, please call Lars on +45 20 87 25 30 or mail him on [lak@praqma.com](mailto:lak@praqma.com).
