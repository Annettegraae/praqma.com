__We would do more events, if we had the bandwidth - you’re it! You will have to be as ambitious about this as we are, and you will have to be prepared to take on more people, and manage them too, even in the very near future.__


<!--break-->

Praqma is a service bureau for companies that produce software. We deliver consultancy services, training and Open Source software development within the well defined niche of Continuous Delivery and DevOps.

For the past two years we have been growing by more than 100% and we have expanded our business to include not only Denmark, but also Norway, and Sweden. We have offices in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Oslo and Stockholm and we’re about to open in Göteborg.

Besides our consultancy services, we deliver training and we run meetups and conferences.

_A lot_ of conferences, meetups, and trainings actually!

Up until now, our community activities and events have been run by our sales and marketing team. But as we’re expanding our business in general, we need you to come and join us, and be responsible for planning, organizing, and executing our events. You will become part of our sales and marketing team, and together with them, cover all three Scandinavian countries.

Our sales and marketing is located in Copenhagen, so it's probably most convenient, you are located in that area too, at least you should be prepared to spend a considerable amount of you work in Copenhagen.

## What's the job

To give you an idea of our activities:

* In the past 12 months we have run five conferences with 150-200 participants each
* Our consultants are organizers or co-organizers in more than 25 MeetUp groups throughout Scandinavia. We have a meetup almost every second week, somewhere in one of these groups
* We do training, sometimes open classes, but most often customized for clients several times every month
* We organize full-day workshops with as many as 50 participants at a time, at least a couple of times per year

As an event manager in Praqma, you will be planning events - in detail - and be responsible for executing them. You will coordinate all the tasks and delegate to sale, marketing, consultants, runners, speakers, venues, photographers, bloggers etc.

You will be responsible for the content on our conference web site [www.code-conf.com](http://www.code-conf.com){: target="_blank" } and you will plan - and to a large extend also execute - the communication on all our channels; Twitter, LinkedIn, Web, newsletters, press releases ...the lot!

We need you to manage and coordinate this. At the end of the day, it will be a team effort for the sales and marketing team which you will become part of - but this particular area; events, will be yours! There will be plenty of people to help with different parts of it, but anything that can’t be delegated, will fall back to you.

## Are you it?

This is not your average Event manager position. We would do more events, if we had the bandwidth - you’re it! You will have to be as ambitious about this as we are, and you will have to be prepared to take on more people, and manage them too, even in the very near future.

We believe you have an educational background in sale, marketing, business development, communication or something along those lines, and we also imagine that you’ve been doing something similar before - so you know what you are about to join.

If “you” exist, please apply for this job at the email address jobs@praqma.com.
We will of course expect to see your CV, but if you already have that updated online, on LinkedIn or somewhere else, pointing us to it would be just fine.
What we really expect from you, when you apply, is a motivational letter (in PDF format) where you put yourself in the context of Praqma, and explain to us, why this job has your name written all over it.

If you have any questions before you do that, please call Lars on +45 20 87 25 30 or mail him on [lak@praqma.com](mailto:lak@praqma.com).
