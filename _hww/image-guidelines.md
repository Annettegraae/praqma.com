* Most images are adjusted with extra light, higher contrast and lower temperature.

* Black-white images are created by lowering the saturation.

* In Gimp or Photoshop, a masking layer can be added to non-orange parts of an image, in order to create the look of black-white with orange details.


- We never re-use an image for other content.
- We do reuse web-images on adjacent printed material
- We avoid generic illustration (e.g. a drawing of a toolbox or a computer)
- We apply our own photo material whenever possible
- In case we need other photos, we image-search for non-copyrighted material
