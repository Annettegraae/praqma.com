## Five Day on-site intensive hands-on training
{: .subtitle}


University is a great learning environment, but it doesn't always teach all the skills you need to be successful in a professional development team.

We have put together a 5-day finishing school for fresh graduates, aimed at getting them up and running in no time.  Based on the training materials we have developed, it covers:

<ul class="checkmark">
 <li><strong>Git</strong>: Advanced version control in a team setting</li>
 <li><strong>Jenkins</strong> : Build and test automation</li>
 <li><strong>Test Driven Development</strong> : Build quality in</li>
 <li><strong>Docker</strong> : Build, Ship, Run anywhere</li>
</ul>

The course structure is module based, with each module containing an instructor-led presentation of each topic followed by either lab exercises or discussions.

Attendees are welcome to bring questions or challenges from their own background.
