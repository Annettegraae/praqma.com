## Two Day on-site intensive hands-on training

This class is intensive and hands-on. We have a complete lab set-up where you will gain fast paced experiences to take home, ready to apply in your environment. You only need to bring a laptop. The course provides you with a thorough grounding in Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery concepts and give you the necessary skills to implement them using Jenkins.
It will teach you how to configure and utilize Jenkins to itâ€™s full potential as the foundation of the tool-stack that will accelerate the software development process.You will learn how to automate and execute anything from within Jenkins, taking a deep dive into all aspects of automated deployment, automated testing, code metrics, advanced support for Version Control Systems, integration to task management systems, and we will discuss and demonstrate the different interfaces that can be used to extend, automate and tweak Jenkins in the direction that suits your needs exactly.
The course structure is module based, with each module containing an instructor lead presentation of each topic followed by either lab exercises or discussions. Attendees are welcome to bring questions or challenges from their own background.
