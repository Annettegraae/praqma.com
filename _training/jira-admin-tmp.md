## One Day intensive hands-on training
This course will provide participants with sufficient knowledge of the different strategies, tools, and techniques in Atlassianâ€™s JIRA to take on the role as JIRA administrator.
Participants will get a guided tour of how JIRA is organized and get hands-on experience working with JIRA and the various functions and tasks relevant to JIRA administrators.

The course will provide a solid understanding of all the configurable components involved in creating and managing JIRA projects. In addition, participants will be made familiar with general JIRA project administrator tasks such as adapting project details, customization, and configuration of workflows, customization of fields, creating new projects and dashboards, as well as troubleshooting etc.

Participants will be familiarized with the relationships and dependencies in JIRA configuration and how JIRA is configured effectively from scratch as well as efficient maintenance of configurations in the future.

We will cover the user management and permissions, as well as explore the different types of schemes they work with. Finally, we will look deeper into the details of global JIRA permissions versus project permissions, and best practices for managing user access to different types of projects.

At the end of the course, participants will be able to effectively manage multiple JIRA projects using best practices and avoid common pitfalls and possess adequate knowledge to manage JIRA projects.

The course is run as a mixture of theory and hands-on exercises.
