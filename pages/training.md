# Training _by Praqma_{: .highlight}

## Know your tools - learn the secrets
At Praqma we pride ourselves on being tool experts.  We don't just skim a howto
and get to work.  We demand to understand everything about the tools we use,
evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, test them in production-like
envrionments, and learn the best way to use them.

## At Praqma we like to share.
We strive to change the world for the better, a little bit at a time.
And one of our favorite activities is teaching great Developers and Operations
how best to employ brilliant software.

We have a bias towards **hands-on training** because we think the is best way
to learn, and also the most fun!  You can expect all of our classes to be
taught by our experts in an interactive, bring-your-laptop approach.

As *certified training partners* within tool stacks such as **Docker** and
**Atlassian** and as experts in **Jenkins CI** and **Git**, we canâ€™t wait to
help you build better, deploy faster and run smoother.
