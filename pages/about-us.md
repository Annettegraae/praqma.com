# About _Praqma_{: .highlight}

We’re a service company specialized in helping companies to assess, plan, implement, improve and develop an infrastructure and process that will support, that quality is _build into_ the product as part of the development processes, as opposed to _glued on_, after it’s finished.

We usually refer to this discipline as continuous delivery - and we simply abbreviated it CoDe: _Co_ for Continuous and _De_ for Delivery.

We're the Continuous Delivery Company.

In Praqma we like to think that we’re special in the sense that we only employ people who are CoDe’ers at heart. Our consultants all have either Software Engineer or System Operations background and CoDe is the career path they
have explicitly chosen.
