# About _Praqma_{: .highlight}

In Praqma we strive to change the world…
…a little bit — at least the software development world.

Continuous Delivery to everybody

During the first 7 years of our existence, we have helped a large number of companies in and outside Denmark implement Continuous Delivery — even before anyone started using the term. We consider ourselves Continuous Delivery Toolsmiths and help our customers with inspiration, strategic consulting, and practical implementation and support.

We’re a service company specialized in helping companies to assess, plan, implement, improve and develop an infrastructure and process that will support, that quality is _build into_ the product as part of the development processes, as opposed to _glued on_, after it’s finished.

We usually refer to this discipline as continuous delivery - and we simply abbreviated it CoDe: _Co_ for Continuous and _De_ for Delivery.

We're the Continuous Delivery Company.

In Praqma we like to think that we’re special in the sense that we only employ people who are CoDe’ers at heart. Our consultants all have either Software Engineer or System Operations background and CoDe is the career path they
have explicitly chosen.
