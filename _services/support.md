## Help when and where you need it - from experts you can trust
{: .subtitle}

The Praqma Support Plan is an insurance policy for your software development infrastructure.
It is an annual subscription that gives you access to our team of CoDers, experts in implementing and maintaining software development infrastructure. 
We are partners with companies such as CloudBees, Atlassian, Docker and more, and working with their tools is what we are best at.

The most effective software organizations take a best-of-breed approach to their software development environment.

Does this sound like you?

You use Git for version control because it is the most powerful version control system available. 
As a server you choose Atlassian Bitbucket to get integration of your JIRA project management with your source control system. 
You use Jenkins, the open source continuous integration server, to automate your build and test systems and use many of its great plugins to get quality feedback and integration with your third party systems. 
All your build artifacts get archived in the Artifactory server for distribution. 
You run your build and test environments in Docker containers and Vagrant virtual machines.

Maybe you donâ€™t have the exact same toolstack, but you probably have something that looks similar and it is great. 
You put a big effort into creating this well-oiled machine.

Just one problem... who do you call when you need help? 
Sure, you can get Jenkins Enterprise from CloudBees and Artifactory Pro, etc., but who will help you on the full-stack questions? 
Who do you call when you need advice on a new branching strategy, competitive analysis or when something goes wrong between the boundaries of your various systems?

We offer you something better.

 * Access to our team of engineers whenever you need it
 * Up to 80 hours of support included
 * On- and off-site as necessary
 * Covers your entire toolstack, both open source and proprietary
 * Can be used for advice, upgrades, maintenance or emergencies

Have the best of both worlds: a custom, best-of-breed development environment and someone to turn to when you need it. 
Every support agreement comes with these additional benefits:
{: .highlight}

* We are a team of experienced developers - we know when a developer's workspace is efficient and when it's not. We would never compromise the pace of a developer's productivity.
* With the combination of our diverse skillsets we can service any tool or issue. You will you have access to our entire team.
* We have setup chains that are so tight that every single code commit is automatically validated and tested right up to the point where it will pass as release candidate (or rejected in the attempt). Just try to imagine what a such fine masked safety net can do to a project's velocity.
* We have setup toolstacks that are compliant with both FDA, ISO, and Solvency regulatory rules.
* Unless IP rules prevent us, we always deliver features, fixes and solutions to the Public Domain community of the tool involved. This implies that you will have instant access to all the solutions that we have ever delivered to all the customers and communities we have ever serviced. You will become part of an exclusive club of Praqma customers who implicitly work together.
* You can use the account you have with us for second line support, bug fixing, tool setup, configuration, training, coaching, strategic planning and feature development. We will even write your unit tests for you - It's your account, you decide.

It all starts with a visit.
