## Help when you need it - from experts you can trust
{: .subtitle}

The Praqma Support Plan is an Insurance policy for your software development infrastructure.
It is an annual subscription that gives you access to our team of CoDer’s, experts in implementing and maintaining software development infrastructure.  We are partners with Cloudbees, Atlassian, Docker and more companies, and working with these tools is what we are best at.

Does this sound like you?

You use git for version control, because it is the most powerful version control system available.  As a server you choose Atlassian Bitbucket, to get integration of your jira project management with your source control system.  You use jenkins, the open source continuous integration server to automate your build and test systems, and many of the great plugins to get quality feedback and integration with your 3rd party systems.  All your build artifacts get archived in the artifactory server for distribution.  You run your build and test environments in docker containers and vagrant virtual machines.

Maybe you don’t have exactly the same toolstack, but you probably have something that looks a bit similar.  And it is great.  You have made a big effort to create this well oiled machine.

There is only one problem...who do you call when you need help?  Sure, you can get Jenkins enterprise from CloudBees and Artifactory Pro,  etc. but who will help you on the full stack questions?  Who do you call if you need advice on a new branching strategy, competitive analysis, or when something goes wrong between the boundaries of various systems.

We want to offer you something better.

 * Access to our team of engineers when you need it
 * Up to 80 hours of support included
 * On- or off-site as necessary
 * Covers all of your tool stack, both open source and proprietary
 * Can be used for advice, upgrades, maintenance or emergencies

Have the best of both worlds: a custom, best-of-breed development environment and someone to turn to when you need it.  Every support agreement comes with these additional benefits:
{: .highlight}

* We are a team of experienced developers - we know when a developer's workspace is efficient and when it's not. We would never compromise the pace of a developer's productivity.
* The combination of our different skills means, that we can literally service any tool or issue. You will you have access to our entire team.
* We have setup chains that are so tight, that every single code commit is automatically validated and tested right up to the point where it will pass as release candidate (or rejected in the attempt). Just try to imagine what a fine masked safety net of that kind can do to a project's velocity.
* We have setup tool stacks that are compliant with both FDA, ISO, and Solvency regulatory rules.
* Unless IP rules prevent us, we always deliver features, fixes, and solutions to the Public Domain community of the tool involved. This implies that you will have instant access to all the solutions that we have ever delivered to all the customers and communities we have ever serviced. You will become part of an exclusive club of Praqma customers who implicitly work together.
* You can use the account you have with us for Second Line Support, bug fixing, tool setup, configuration, training, coaching, strategic planning, or feature development. We will even write your unit tests for you - It's your account, you decide.

It all starts with a visit!

Get in touch and invite us to a cup of coffee - we drink a lot of coffee.
