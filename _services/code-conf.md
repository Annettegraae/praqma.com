## Continuous Delivery conferences and meetups

Praqma has been organizing community events and meetups on a regular basis.  Beginning with Continuous Delivery Users meetup groups, through hosting the Jenkins Scandinavia, on to creating the CoDeConf concept, we have dedicated ourselves to improve the software communities we are part of.

Passion is an overused word in our business - but we care deeply about Continuous Delivery.  We create the events we wished existed, and make them available to everyone.
