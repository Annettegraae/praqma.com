## Continuous Delivery conferences and meetups

Praqma has been organizing community events and meetups on a regular basis.
Beginning with Continuous Delivery Users meetup groups, through hosting the Jenkins Scandinavia and on to creating the CoDeConf concept,
we have dedicated ourselves to improving the software communities we are part of.

Passion is an overused word in our business - but we care deeply about Continuous Delivery.
We create the events we wish existed and make them available to everyone.
