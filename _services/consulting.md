## We don't chop wood.  We sharpen axes.

Software development is a challenging, chaotic endeavor.  In the quest for
survival and market success it is all too easy to focus on chopping the wood
rather than sharpening the axe.  Software is your business, sharpening axes is
ours.  We can help you identify, prioritize and remove
the bottlenecks from your software development process.  We help our clients:

* Remove manual and error prone processes
* Create frictionless development environments
* Teach best practices
* Implement automation

## Buy a man, get a team

We hire and train the best in the field of Continuous Delivery and DevOps.  People that love to fix things, automate everything, and improve the world of software development.  Then we direct them at tough problems in your organization.

We will never sell you a body or a named resource.  The continuous delivery
ecosystem requires an ever-expanding skill set that is not available in just
one person.  So when you enter into an consulting engagement with us, you don't
need to choose between a strategic consulting expert, a Jenkins ninja, an
IT infrastructure automation guru, or a top trainer.  We will use our pool of
experts to get you exactly the skills you need, when you need them.
