## Being SAFE - while being dependent on Open Source
{: .subtitle}

Josra is an alliance that supports the members in feeling safe when they are dependent on Open Source tools in their software development process. By pooling together interests, resources, genuine needs and Open Source experts with lots of good community karma, Josra facilitates best practices and joint development on the Open Source tool that is shared among the members.

JOSRA enables the members to contribute by proxy, meaning that JOSRA members can take on the role as innovator both through influencing the roadmaps of the tools maintained by the alliance and by exploiting the support and development cases included in the membership. This influence can be exercised without actually having to re-school employees away from the core business domain and into becoming Open Source experts. Praqma has substantial Open Source community karma. This is our business. We will do it for you.
