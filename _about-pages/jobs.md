# CoDe:er at heart

We abbreviate Continuous delivery as CoDe. _Co_ for Continuous and _De_ for delivery.

The position title we use is "Continuous Deliverer" or just plain "CoDe:er".

If you know what we mean then you have probably got it - the DevOps. You are already doing it, aren't you? That is why you are reading this page.

If you're a code at heart we encourage you to contact us. We have offices in Aller√∏d, Aarhus, Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm and we're hiring in all locations.
