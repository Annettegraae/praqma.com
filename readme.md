All pages and tag-pages with *nav-weight* in frontmatter go to menu. They are sorted by *nav-weight* from frontmatter (small values go first).

Helpers
---
*_config.dev.yml* is extremely useful during development. It can alter some variables. Start Jekyll with
```
jekyll build --config "_config.yml,_config.dev.yml" --watch
```

Posts
---
All posts are treated as they have tag `Newest`. We add it in `_includes/posts.html`

* tag — tag to filter. Register sensetive.
* limit — number of posts. Skip to output all.
* avatar-alignment — avatar alignment
* sort — name of filed to sort. Skip to filter by date.

You can skip any of `posts.html` parameters.

Stories blog post are supposed to be reviewed and get feedback before being published, check our handbook: https://github.com/Praqma/handbook/blob/master/the_orange_way/blogging.md

### Developer tips

Fire up the website to browse it locally using our gh-pages container: https://github.com/Praqma/docker-gh-pages

Use: `docker run -i -t -v /home/user/mysite:/home/jenkins -p 4444:4000 praqma/gh-pages jekyll serve --watch --host=0.0.0.0`

Usually posts are using `published: false` to start with so they are not public on our before we coordinate it. 

Add the `--unpublished` parameter to the above command to see those get build and published on local version also.




### Tags

Convention: all tags should start with capital letter.

### Tables

To underline header, separate it with `|---|` or any other acceptable separator

To make table columns have equal width, add `equal` class to this table like this:
```
| Small text | Big text |
|-
| Sma... | Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! Big text! |
{:.equal}
```

It will be rendered to

Unfortunately, kramdown doesn't support `caption` element of table. So captions should be used like
```
From *Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind (Harari)*, pp 41
{:.table-caption}
```
